# Landing Page Project

## Introduction

A Landing Page project that aims to demonstrate the ability to  manipulate the DOM by:

* Dynamically creating and updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page
* When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scroll smoothly to the selected section.
* Adding an active state to the navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
* Add an active state to sections when a section is in the viewport.

*Note for the reviewer: For the element in viewport function i read [the article at](https://gomakethings.com/how-to-test-if-an-element-is-in-the-viewport-with-vanilla-javascript/)
until the **Determining if the element is in the viewport** section. Then wrote my function without
viewing the rest of the article until i finished writing my function and making sure it works.*
